This file is a lab notebook of sorts, keeping track of the work on the SDU exercise

##### Saturday 14/1/2023
- Thought about the exercise... 

##### Sunday 14/1/2023
- installed Django
- installed PostgreSQL via Postgres.app
- installed pgAdmin 4

##### Monday 14/1/2023
- Lerned about PostgreSQL and related
- imported the data into PostgreSQL (see import_table.sql file)
- familiarized with data during the process of importing. Several potential issues
    -   A column name Order is a reserved word, see here, used "" to avoid issues when importing; possibly rename the column in the future. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10891368/postgres-table-column-name-restrictions    
    - organization.csv file has XXXXX in some fields
    - organisations.csv sometimes uses , and not . for decimals
    - projects.csv could not handle empty fileds if importing as TIMESTAMP/DATE type; temporary solution is to import as TEXT
    - some rows have CLOSED instead of CLO as a value
    - two data files have different stadards for decimal points, and one has "" around values, while the othe one does not. 


##### Tuesday 14/1/2023
- changed directions, decided to do the data import in Django
- created a project in Django and made the first model

##### Wednesday 14/1/2023
- committed the first version of the project onto GitHub
- imported organization.csv and projects.csv tables into Django as a pandas data frame
- lots of time spent refining the models, organizing files and understanding the workflow better

##### Wednesday 14/1/2023
- data cleaning and resolving data issues, specifically
    - missing data in date fields
- successfully imported projects into the database
